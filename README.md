A starboard in python! Supports a lot, from Dank Memer snipe command support to being able to set how many stars are needed to get on the starboard (believe it or not, some starboards don't have this feature).

However, this bot has been mostly been made for personal use. It has support for other people running it themselves, however, it requires a MySQL database, and requires you (for now) to manually add a row in starboard_config for every server it joins.

Environment vars: MAIN_TOKEN, DB_HOST_URL, DB_PORT, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME.
