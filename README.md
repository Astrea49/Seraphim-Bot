# EOL Notice
While I may come back to this one day, there seems to various issues with the bot that I cannot fix, ESPECIALLY with database syncing issues. It was fun while it lasted.

A personal bot made for server I mod in. Meant to be extremely versatile and changable and helping out those servers with tasks otherwise made more difficult with other bots.

Environment vars: MAIN_TOKEN, DB_HOST_URL, DB_PORT, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME, LOG_FILE_PATH.
