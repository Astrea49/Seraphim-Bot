A personal bot made for features usually not seen with other bots, done poorly by other bots, or done by bots with poor uptimes. This bot is meant to be an extension to other bots - it will not handle the basics like banning and kicking. Use another bot for that.

Initially started out as a starboard bot, so that's where most of the effort goes to, but the bot does do many other features as well, like a pinboard, sniping, image compressing. pingable roles with a custom cooldown... you get the point.

No setup tutorial because I doubt anyone would even run their own instance. If you do decide you want to, you'll have to look in the code itself to find what you need.
